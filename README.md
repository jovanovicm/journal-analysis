# 📓✏️ An analysis of my journal ✏️📓
### Introduction
In 2022, I started tracking how I used my time to better understand myself, and to work towards being more productive with it.
I would track the time I woke up and went to bed, the activities I did during the day, the people I spent time with,
and I would conclude my journal entries with a rating of my day. 

**I will breakdown how my year went through data!**

### Format
My journal entries would have the date at the top in MM/DD/YYYY format, times I did the activities at in a 12-hour format, and a rating on a 10 point scale with **1** being the worst possible day ever (ex. [losing way too much money in crypto](https://www.coindesk.com/embedded-chart/bn8BwGjpJchB7)), and **10** being the opposite.
